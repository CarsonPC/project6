    "> ABSTRACT: Voltage spikes occur when current is abruptly interrupted and can damage inadequately protected equipment. To install protective equipment, one must find the resistance and inductance of the object carrying the current. Using Maxwells Equations one can relate the resistance and inductance to the intensity of the magnetic field induced by the current. The authors suggest a Helmholtz equation using discrete methods for computation to model the magnetic field intensity.\n",

    "\n",
    "The engineering firm McMillan-McGee came to $Math^{industry}$ with a thermodynamics problem involving electromagnetic fields that required solving a certain non-homogenous boundary value problem involving Maxwell's equations. McMillan-McGee developed a high frequency inverter. This high frequency alternating current induces an electromagnetic field and if this current is abruptly interrupted then a voltage spike will occur that puts the equipment at risk of being damaged. To install a suitable bus bar system that can absorb energy caused by switching transients from semiconductor devices, both the resistance and inductance of the DC bus bar that supplies the current must be characterized.  \n",

    "Previous work has been done on this subject by Norman McLachlan$^1$ using an ellipse to approximate a rectangular cross-section of a bus bar he developed formulas to find current density, power loss, and high frequency resistance. Unfortunately, McLauchlan's$^1$ work is in Gaussian units instead of MKS units which is undesirable for an engineer. McLachlan$^1$ draws the conclusion that the surface distribution of current density is identical to that of a bar holding an electric charge. Hence, the total current flowing axially on the bus bar corresponds to the total surface charge.\n",

    "<h3> Theory </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The bus bar being made of copper allows itself to be a good conductor which the magnetic field barely penetrates. As such, the problem can be reduced from three dimensions to two dimensions, only observing the surface layer. The component of the magnetic field normal to the bar's surface tends to decay exponentially. Thus, the magnetic field is roughly tangential to the bus bar and it follows that on the surface the vector magnetic potential is constant and satisfies the same conditions as the electrostatic potential. Using Maxwell's Equation's we can relate the intensity of the electric field to the resistance and inductance.\n",

    "With those conditions and constants, we apply the usual second-order finite difference scheme to discretize the Helmholtz equation on the rectangular domain. We solve the resultant linear system using discrete separation of variables. This method has a time complexity of $O(n^3)$ as opposed to Gaussian Elimination which has a cumbersome $O(n^6)$ time complexity$^2$, where $n=\\frac{1}{h}$ where $h$ is the size of the grid in each direction. In the elliptic case we applied continuous piecewise linear finite elements to solve the problem. To ensure the integrity of the data from our algorithm we tested it on an exact solution where the electric intensity was $u(x,y)=x^2-y^2$ the wave number $k=1$ and the forcing term $F=y^2-x^2$. Testing both the simple separation of variables and eigen-value decomposition separation of variables we tracked both the runtime and error of each algorithm, \n",

    "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Having created the rectangular model that accurately depicts the scenario of current flowing through a copper bus bar, Maxwells Equations can be used to characterize resistance and inductance. Knowing the resistance and inductance will allow McGillan-McGee to alter the copper bus bar in such a way that voltage spikes will not run back through it and ruin the attached machinery. The elliptical model we created will allow McGillan-McGee to continue following along McLachlan's$^1$ work and potentially pursue a different avenue.\n",
