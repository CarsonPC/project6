    "Having created the rectangular model that accurately depicts the scenario of current flowing through a copper bus bar, Maxwells Equations can be used to characterize resistance and inductance. Knowing the resistance and inductance will allow McGillan-McGee to alter the copper bus bar in such a way that voltage spikes will not run back through it and ruin the attached machinery. The elliptical model we created will allow McGillan-McGee to continue following along McLachlan's$^1$ work and potentially pursue a different avenue."

    "We would like to express our deep gratitude to our terrific mentor, Dr. Shaun Lui, for his time and wisdom. Shaun has done a terrific job of introducing us to the right materials that we needed in order to endeavour on our problem.We would also wish to thank  our industry mentor, Edwin Reid, for the opportunity to work on this project with him and  for his eagernes to share his industry expertise. Finally, we want to thank the organizers of the PIMS $Math^{Industry}$ workshop, specially to Professors Allen Herman and Kristine Bauer for their support. "
